When China shut down in late February due to the coronavirus pandemic, they reduced their oil consumption, which meant that the proportion of oil coming from these cheaper sources increased. As a result, the average gasoline price in China remained low, while gasoline prices around the world increased by about 40%. This helped to lower inflation in China, as the rising cost of gasoline is a major driver of inflation. By contrast, the high gasoline prices in other countries contributed to inflation in those countries.\n",
